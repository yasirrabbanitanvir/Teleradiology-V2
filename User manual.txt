Step 1: Understand the Django Admin Panel
You’re logged in as afsar (your superuser) at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.
The left sidebar shows sections like Authentication and Authorization (for users and groups) and Myapp (for your custom models like Centers, Patients, etc.).
You’ll use the + Add buttons to create new items.
Step 2: Create Groups (Roles)
Groups define the roles (Admin, SubAdmin, Center, Doctor). Let’s create them if they’re not already there.

Go to Groups:
In the sidebar, click on Groups under Authentication and Authorization.
Add Each Group:
Click the green + Add button next to Groups.
In the Name field, type Admin and click Save.
Repeat this process to add:
SubAdmin
Center
Doctor
After adding each, click Save and return to the group list.
Verify Groups:
You should see Admin, SubAdmin, Center, and Doctor listed. If they’re there, you’re good to go!
Step 3: Create Centers
Centers are where patients’ data will be managed. Let’s add a couple.

Go to Centers:
In the sidebar, click on Centers under Myapp.
Add a Center:
Click the green + Add button next to Centers.
Fill in the fields:
Name: Type Center1
Institute name: Type Hospital1
Is default: Check the box (click the checkbox)
Click Save.
Add Another Center (Optional):
Click + Add again.
Fill in:
Name: Type Center2
Institute name: Type Hospital2
Is default: Leave unchecked
Click Save.
Verify Centers:
You should see Center1 and Center2 in the list.
Step 4: Create Users and Assign Roles
Now, let’s create users for each role and link them to the right groups and centers.

Go to Users:
In the sidebar, click on Users under Authentication and Authorization.
Add a SubAdmin User:
Click the green + Add button next to Users.
Fill in:
Username: Type subadmin1
Password: Type subadminpassword (at least 8 characters)
Password (again): Type subadminpassword again
(Optional) Email: Type subadmin1@example.com
Click Save.
Add a Center User:
Click + Add again.
Fill in:
Username: Type center1
Password: Type centerpassword
Password (again): Type centerpassword again
(Optional) Email: Type center1@example.com
Click Save.
Add a Doctor User:
Click + Add again.
Fill in:
Username: Type doctor1
Password: Type doctorpassword
Password (again): Type doctorpassword again
(Optional) Email: Type doctor1@example.com
Click Save.
Assign Roles via User Profiles:
In the sidebar, click on User profiles under Myapp.
Click the green + Add button next to User profiles.
For subadmin1:
User: Select subadmin1 from the dropdown
Role: Select SubAdmin from the dropdown
Leave Center blank
Click Save.
For center1:
User: Select center1
Role: Select Center
Center: Select Center1 from the dropdown
Click Save.
For doctor1:
User: Select doctor1
Role: Select Doctor
Leave Center blank
Click Save.
Link Center User to Center:
Go back to Centers under Myapp.
Click on Center1 to edit it.
In the User dropdown, select center1.
Click Save.
Step 5: Log Out and Log In as Different Roles
You need to log out of the Admin session to test other users.

Log Out from Admin:
In the top-right corner of the Django admin panel, click your username (afsar) and select Log out.
Clear Local Storage (Optional):
Open your browser’s Developer Tools (press F12).
Go to the Application tab.
Under Local Storage > http://127.0.0.1:8000, right-click and select Clear to remove the old token and role.
Log In as SubAdmin:
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/login.html.
Enter:
Username: subadmin1
Password: subadminpassword
Click Login.
You should be redirected to http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html. Explore the SubAdmin dashboard (e.g., assign doctors).
Log In as Center:
Log out (click Log Off on index.html if available, or clear localStorage again).
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/login.html.
Enter:
Username: center1
Password: centerpassword
Click Login.
You should be redirected to http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html. Click "Patient Entry" to go to form.html and add a patient.
Log In as Doctor:
Log out again.
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/login.html.
Enter:
Username: doctor1
Password: doctorpassword
Click Login.
You should be redirected to http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/doctor.html. Select your doctor name and practice uploading a report.
Step 6: Practice Using the System
Now, let’s practice with each role:

As Center (center1):
On index.html, click "Patient Entry" to go to form.html.
Fill in:
Name: John Doe
Age: 30
Sex: M
Body Part: Chest
Modality: CT
Center and Institute name should auto-fill as Center1 and Hospital1
Scan Date/Time: Pick a date/time
Upload a dummy .dcm file (create a text file, rename it to sample.dcm)
Click Submit and check if the patient appears on index.html.
As SubAdmin (subadmin1):
On index.html, find John Doe in the table.
Check the checkbox next to the patient.
In the assign panel, select Dr. Alice Smith from the dropdown.
Click Assign and verify the patient’s status updates.
As Doctor (doctor1):
On doctor.html, select Dr. Razib Bari from the dropdown.
Search for John Doe using filters.
Click Upload Report, select a dummy .pdf file (create a text file, rename it to report.pdf), and upload it.
Change the status to Reported and save.
Step 7: Keep Practicing
Add more patients, centers, and doctors via the Django admin panel.
Test the search filters and emergency case checkboxes.
If something doesn’t work, note the error (e.g., in the browser console with F12) and let me know!
